# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Purpose
Use K-Means (Unsupervised Machine Learning Model) to identify clusters in the data and determine which group of customers is aligned with each credit card. Create a dashboard that allows stakeholders to determine more insights per cluster through an interactive interface.
